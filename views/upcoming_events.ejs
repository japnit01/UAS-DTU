                <p>The development of a Robotic Arm with 6DOF along Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) setup is currently being done. The aim is to automate crop harvesting and management interventions through the usage of visual-based crop detection deep learning models on the setup. The further aim is to develop a swarm of crop harvesting UGV. Furthermore, the focus will also be on making the UAVs competent to Detect, Track and Capture stationary and moving objects on both the surface, and just below the surface of the water. The goal of the competition is also to make the UAVs capable of performing certain hospital ward related tasks including the changing of Intravenous Drips, Bed Linen and Contact Based Cleaning.</p>

                <p>The goal of this Competition is to demonstrate the utility of Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) for civilian applications, particularly in those applications that will save the lives of people in the future. In this competition, competitors will be required to develop an autonomous flying system that could save lives by quickly and cost effectively providing a live video and audio stream from a remote accident site in the Australian Outback to a medical team travelling to provide medical assistance.
